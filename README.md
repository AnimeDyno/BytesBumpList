# Setting Up
**‚ö†Ô∏è YOU WILL NEED A MONGODB FOR IT, CHECK [THIS REPO](https://github.com/Nemika-Haj/BytesBump) ON HOW TO SET IT UP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

üìù **Note: This server list supports only bots originating from [BytesBump](https://github.com/Nemika-Haj/BytesBump). However, if you are experienced enough, you can modify it to your own needs**

## **Configuring `settings.json`**
- First of all, rename `settings-example.json` to `settings.json`
- Replace its content with proper values.
### __Example__
```json
{
    "site_name": "BytesBump Server List",
    "mongo": "mongo-uri (same as the bot's)",
    "bot_token": "bump bot's token"
}
```
- Go to your **BytesBump** `settings.json`, and set `enable-serverlist` to `true` and change the `serverlist_url` to your website's URL. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` is for when the website is hosted locally.
